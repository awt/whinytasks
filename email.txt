Subject: [ANN] whinytasks 0.0.2 Released

whinytasks version 0.0.2 has been released!

* <http://adamthorsen.com/whinytasks>

WhinyTasks is sort of like ExceptionMailer but specifically designed for rake tasks that
run in the background.  With any website, background jobs tend to accumulate and sometimes
it's hard to tell if they're working properly.  WhinyTasks defines the whiny_task method,
which can be used in place of the task method and results in tasks that send emails to
a designated address when an exception occurrs during the execution of the task.

Changes:

### 1.0.0 / 2008-09-06

* added whine_if config var to allow conditional whining based on the environment (production, dev, etc)

  * Birthday!
